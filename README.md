- `Turtle Graphics`
- `Random`

## 🚀 Features

- User betting via input dialog
- Multiple turtle instances racing simultaneously
- Randomized movement on each run
- Clear win/lose outcome based on user choice
- Clean, beginner-friendly visuals

## 📍 The Process

Built as **Day 19 of the 100 Days of Python Code** course to better understand higher-order concepts in Python. This project focused on working with multiple object instances, maintaining unique state for each turtle, handling user input through event-driven interactions, and understanding how functions and logic flow together in an interactive program.

## 🚦 Running the Project

1. Clone the repository  
2. Run the script: `python main.py`  
3. Enter a color when prompted and watch the race  
4. Click anywhere on the window to exit
